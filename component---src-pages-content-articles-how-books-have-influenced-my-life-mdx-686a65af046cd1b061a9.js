I have read through all of its glorious 1800 or so pages twice and have heard it all on audible over 6 times. My favourite story is 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' and it won't be an exaggeration to say that I feel the same sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which had submerged Dr. Watson's mind.\nI didn't love reading from the start. In fact, I was quite annoyed at the thought of reading because I associated books with boring school work in which I had zero interest.
