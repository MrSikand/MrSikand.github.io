Due to Covid-19 we have to stay in our homes unless you want to get the coronavirus(in that case go to a therapy session). Learning has been shifted from live face-to-face to online. Now, we have all experienced online learning. We all have at least thought about the question \"Is this better than school learning?\". This article is not supposed to be a clear cut answer. I have too small a sample size for that. This article will only attempt to list out the PROS and CONS which I and my friends think apply here.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I am heavily biased. I am on the side of online education. So, in order to prevent this from being a RANT, I have asked some of my friends to help me out in this quest.

I also plan on doing a teacher's perspective on this topic (if my teachers agree to it)`}</p>\n    <p>{`So lets list out the PROS and CONS. Then we will weight things accordingly.
