so necessary?</a>\n    <ul>\n  <li>\n    Now you are pretty convinced that you need to fall asleep but there is a\n    huge problem sometimes. Sometimes, you just can&#39;t fall asleep. No matter\n    how hard you try it just seems impossible. This is a problem that I have\n    faced a number of times before. But now, I have a magic strategy that you\n    can use in order to fall asleep faster. That magic strategy is...Counting\n    till you fall asleep. I am kidding. I have counted to a thousand at one\n    night and still couldn&#39;t fall asleep. So lets approach this logically.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    There are two main reasons that prohibit you to fall asleep, the environment\n    and your brain. First, lets look at the environment because that will effect\n    your brain.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The Environment\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        So there is a hormone called Melatonin. You may have heard of it.\n        Basically, what it does is that it tells your brain that it is now dark\n        and you should fall asleep. Now you may realise how important this\n        hormone is. Now what is the problem here? The problem as you may have\n        guessed is that this hormone gets released when it is\n        <strong>DARK</strong> but, in this day and age, our society is a darkness-deprived\n        one.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        I know I know, this isn&#39;t something that you probably wanted to\n        hear. You have to not watch TV at night. Keep your phones in silent mode\n        and put them away. I know that this requires a lot of self-discipline\n        and effort. While putting your phone away you may think what if someone\n        messages me? But the truth is really that no one mostly needs an urgent\n        reply at night. Everyone can wait. If it is so necessary then you can\n        choose to only mute messages not calls. If it is a message then it can\n        most probably wait.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Now, one more giant thing which you can do is follow a consistent\n        schedule. You <strong>SHOULD</strong> to fall asleep and then wake up at\n        the same time everyday no matter if it is a weekend or not. This is a\n        common mistake that people make in constructing a sleep schedule, The\n        mistake is that they often think that I can be easier on weekends. It is\n        not that you should get your healthy 8 hours of sleep only on weekends\n        and try to sleep less in weekdays. Sleep depravation can&#39;t be\n        accumulated only to sorted later. Once gone, sleep <strong>IS</strong>\n        gone. I repeat, it <strong>IS</strong> gone.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        As I addressed earlier, it is very hard to have that kind of\n        self-discipline which allows you to resist the urge for you to use your\n        phone. For this I recommend that you take a look at my\n        <a href=\"How to build habits that stick\">\n          How to build habits that stick\n        </a>\n        article. Building a bedtime is still a habit.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The Brain\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        The problem sometimes is that sometimes, the brain just doesn&#39;t want\n        to shut down. It forces you to re-live your whole day. It forces you to\n        turn over problems in your head. This can not only be anxiety inducing\n        but it also leads to sleep-depravation which as you know is very very\n        dangerous.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        So how do you fight this problem? The main principle to fight this is\n        filling your intentional space with just enough load that it keeps it\n        full but not so full that you basically solving hard maths problems at\n        the end. You can learn more about intentional space and attention in\n        general in the book\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hyperfocus-Manage-Attention-World-Distraction/dp/0525522255/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=hyperfocus&amp;qid=1590737565&amp;sr=8-1\">\n          Hyperfocus\n        </a>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        This is where the 4-3-5 breathing method comes in. The original method\n        is called the 4-7-8 breathing method. In the 4-7-8 method, you have to\n        inhale while counting till 4 then you have to hold your breath while\n        counting till 7 and then exhale while counting till 8. I find this\n        method a bit excessive so I tend to use the 4-3-5 method. You have to\n        count till 4 while inhaling then hold your breath counting till 3 and\n        exhale while counting till 5. Now this may seem kinda sketchy\n        considering the fact that you are still basically counting but this is a\n        method which I have used and it works really well because it involves\n        mindfulness.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    I hope you found this useful and if you did, you may want to check out\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Why+we+sleep&amp;qid=1598441406&amp;sr=8-1\">\n      Why we Sleep\n    </a>\n    by Mathew Walker\n  </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
