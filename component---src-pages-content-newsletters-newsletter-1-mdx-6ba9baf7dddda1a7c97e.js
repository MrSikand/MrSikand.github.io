Progressive Summarization is a specific process of reading, bolding, highlighting, summarizing, and then finally, possibly, rewriting. Progressive Summarization encourages the same thing as the industrial factory-based education system: the production of poor thinkers who are skilled in the regurgitation of other people’s ideas Instead it could have gone to developing your own nuanced perspective to the ideas you encounter, then connecting them with other ideas you’ve already encountered. Let’s call this… Progressive Ideation. Why care? The very essence and quality of our thinking is at stake. Why relegate your best thinking to the last step in an elaborate process? If you are a knowledge worker, an entrepreneur, or just someone who likes to think — Progressive Summarization must die. Progressive Summarization Creates False Confidence The Collector’s Fallacy — coined by Christian Tietze — argues that the act of “collecting” is easy. It feels like progress but it’s not. The same is true with the act of “summarizing”. Let’s call it… The Summarizer’s Fallacy. The last major reason why Progressive Summarization must die is that it doesn’t effectively grow and evolve with you over time. In summary… 1. Progressive Summarization creates a false sense of achievement. 2. Progressive Summarization encourages regurgitative thinking. 3. Progressive Summarization doesn’t build a dynamic digital library. What is Progressive Ideation Progressive Summarization is: “Copy, Bold, Highlight, Summarize, Rewrite.” Progressive Ideation is: “Comment, Convert, Connect, Create.” For the sake of the quality of your thinking, the difference is night and day. Make comments (and highlights) as you go. Convert them into new notes. Progressive Ideation Creates Real Value When you read something new, what if you added comments as you went? (Nothing major, just some comments like you were having an engaging conversation with a friend.) What if you converted some of that information into new notes, each representing a new idea, each written in your own words? What if you then linked these new ideas to existing ideas in your note library? Progressive Ideation Encourages Connective Thinking")}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
