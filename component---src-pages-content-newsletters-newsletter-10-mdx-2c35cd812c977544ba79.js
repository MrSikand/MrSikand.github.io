This time it... Roam42. It is a great extension which kinda supercharges Roam Research(as if we Roam needed to be supercharged). But it seriously adds a lot of new functionality to Roam Research primarily because of its focus on keyboard shortcuts. Being a productive nerd, you want to minimize the time between thinking of an action to do on the computer and the action being done. Now, if I want to go to a particular date, I just need to hit Alt-Shift-j and boom I am picking dates!!
