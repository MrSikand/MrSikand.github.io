It does not teach them\n            how to become readers. In reality, school traumatizes readers.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Ironically, the same institution that is supposed to inspire kids to\n            become curious about education creates the opposite effect.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            As Gustave Flaubert shared in 1867, “Do not read, as children do, to\n            amuse yourself, or like the ambitious, for the purpose of\n            instruction. No, read in order to live.”\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Naval Ravikant&#39;s practical theory for reading is to see how many\n            ideas he can understand and use. It is better to reread the best 100\n            books and know those ideas really well than read all the books.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Spark the fire for your love of reading even if school took that\n            away.
