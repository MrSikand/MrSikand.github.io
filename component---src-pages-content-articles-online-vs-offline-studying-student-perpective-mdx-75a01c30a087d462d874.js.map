Due to Covid-19 we have to stay in our homes unless you want to get the coronavirus(in that case go to a therapy session). Learning has been shifted from live face-to-face to online. Now, we have all experienced online learning. We all have at least thought about the question \"Is this better than school learning?\". This article is not supposed to be a clear cut answer. I have too small a sample size for that. This article will only attempt to list out the PROS and CONS which I and my friends think apply here.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I am heavily biased. I am on the side of online education. So, in order to prevent this from being a RANT, I have asked some of my friends to help me out in this quest. So this article will be mix and match of all the points that we have come up with. I also plan on doing a teacher's perspective on this topic (if my teachers agree to it)`}</p>\n    <p>{`So lets list out the PROS and CONS. Then we will weight things accordingly.

But I think that we get the gist of it. The biggest benefit of Online learning is being Asynchronous whereas the biggest benefit of offline Face-to-Face studying is socialisation. What do you value more? Learning anytime anywhere for free or socialisation. It is up to you to decide.`}</p>\n    <p>{`PS: From this we can see that plain video call classes are the worst as neither can you learn from them anytime anywhere nor can you have social interactions with your friends. If those video calls are recorded then you can make a case for them being online. I will be interested to know your opinions on this.
