That may be articles, websites, newsletters. So lets get\n        into it\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        The first app is the one, the only Roam Research\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Roam Research is just such an awesome tool. You can implement the\n            Resonance Calendar System popularised by Ali Abdaal so efficiently.\n            the backlink functionality is just amazing. I use it daily and\n            extensively. if for some reason, I could use Roam Research, I would\n            have a pretty hard time.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Here is a picture of my graph\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"./images/roam-rectangle-light.png\" alt=\"\" />\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Notion\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            This is the tool that I use for project management. I have a number\n            of projects going on, and Notion helps me to keep track of\n            everything. I don&#39;t use it as much as I used to because Roam\n            Research has replaced many of its functions but still there are so\n            functions of Notion that I Roam Research does have. It sure is a\n            great app\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        OneNote\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            As you know, I love Physics and Maths. I can use Latex and can type\n            kinda fast but still doing Physics and Maths in Latex is kinda\n            cumbersome. I am not going to solve whole problems in latex. I\n            don&#39;t also like using paper, you can end up with piles of paper\n            which you are not sure whether to discard or keep. So, I use OneNote\n            and write using the Surface pen.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        PyCharm\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            The main language that I use for programming is Python and in my\n            opinion, PyCharm is the best Python IDLE.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Visual Studio Code\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            I have very recently started to learn some app development using\n            flutter and I use Visual Studio Code as my IDLE of choice for that\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Sublime Text\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            I have hand coded this website in HTML and CSS with a sprinkle of\n            JS.

But yes I use the command prompt quite\n            a lot. I don&#39;t use it that much now, but when I was learning\n            Django, I used it a lot.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        GitHub desktop\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            This is the app that I use to communicate from my computer to my\n            GitHub repository.

It\n            is basically the price for knowledge you pay and it is totally worth\n            it. I love listening to audiobooks and you can check out my method\n            for consuming books and audiobooks here.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Reddit\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Its the place for me to hangout for like 10 minutes a day. It is a\n            nice place to ask questions and get answers. It gives you that kind\n            of community feeling.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Shonen Jump\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            It is the best platform (at least in that I know of) to get some\n            manga. it has basically all the manga that you will wish to read.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Google Podcasts\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            My podcast platform of choice is Google podcasts.

I use a pretty simple Surface Go\n            with 8 Gigs of RAM and frankly speaking, chrome is too heavy for it.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Google Calender\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            It is basically the calendar app of choice. I just use it to keep my\n            routine. It gives me a nice view of my routine. I haven&#39;t really\n            tried a lot of calendar apps and I find that the Google Calendar app\n            works fine.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        OneDrive\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            I backup my pictures, documents. It is a grate service and I love\n            using it. I would have gone for Google Drive but I subscribe to\n            Microsoft 365 and 1 TB of OneDrive storage is included so I just use\n            OneDrive.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Power Toys\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            It is a fun addon for windows.
