Progressive\nSummarization is a specific process of reading, bolding, highlighting, summarizing,\nand then finally, possibly, rewriting. Progressive Summarization encourages the same\nthing as the industrial factory-based education system: the production of poor thinkers\nwho are skilled in the regurgitation of other people’s ideas Instead it could have\ngone to developing your own nuanced perspective to the ideas you encounter, then\nconnecting them with other ideas you’ve already encountered. Let’s call this… Progressive\nIdeation. Why care? The very essence and quality of our thinking is at stake. Why\nrelegate your best thinking to the last step in an elaborate process? If you are\na knowledge worker, an entrepreneur, or just someone who likes to think — Progressive\nSummarization must die. Progressive Summarization Creates False Confidence The Collector’s\nFallacy — coined by Christian Tietze — argues that the act of “collecting” is easy.\nIt feels like progress but it’s not. The same is true with the act of “summarizing”.\nLet’s call it… The Summarizer’s Fallacy. The last major reason why Progressive Summarization\nmust die is that it doesn’t effectively grow and evolve with you over time. In summary…\n1. Progressive Summarization creates a false sense of achievement. 2. Progressive\nSummarization encourages regurgitative thinking. 3. Progressive Summarization doesn’t\nbuild a dynamic digital library. What is Progressive Ideation Progressive Summarization\nis: “Copy, Bold, Highlight, Summarize, Rewrite.” Progressive Ideation is: “Comment,\nConvert, Connect, Create.” For the sake of the quality of your thinking, the difference\nis night and day. Make comments (and highlights) as you go. Convert them into new\nnotes. Progressive Ideation Creates Real Value When you read something new, what\nif you added comments as you went? (Nothing major, just some comments like you were\nhaving an engaging conversation with a friend.) What if you converted some of that\ninformation into new notes, each representing a new idea, each written in your own\nwords? What if you then linked these new ideas to existing ideas in your note library?\nProgressive Ideation Encourages Connective Thinking\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
