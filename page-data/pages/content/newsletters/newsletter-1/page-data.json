Progressive Summarization is a specific process of reading, bolding, highlighting, summarizing, and then finally, possibly, rewriting. Progressive Summarization encourages the same thing as the industrial factory-based education system: the production of poor thinkers who are skilled in the regurgitation of other people\\u2019s ideas Instead it could have gone to developing your own nuanced perspective to the ideas you encounter, then connecting them with other ideas you\\u2019ve already encountered. Let\\u2019s call this\\u2026 Progressive Ideation. Why care? The very essence and quality of our thinking is at stake. Why relegate your best thinking to the last step in an elaborate process? If you are a knowledge worker, an entrepreneur, or just someone who likes to think \\u2014 Progressive Summarization must die. Progressive Summarization Creates False Confidence The Collector\\u2019s Fallacy \\u2014 coined by Christian Tietze \\u2014 argues that the act of \\u201Ccollecting\\u201D is easy. It feels like progress but it\\u2019s not. The same is true with the act of \\u201Csummarizing\\u201D. Let\\u2019s call it\\u2026 The Summarizer\\u2019s Fallacy. The last major reason why Progressive Summarization must die is that it doesn\\u2019t effectively grow and evolve with you over time. In summary\\u2026 1. Progressive Summarization creates a false sense of achievement. 2. Progressive Summarization encourages regurgitative thinking. 3. Progressive Summarization doesn\\u2019t build a dynamic digital library. What is Progressive Ideation Progressive Summarization is: \\u201CCopy, Bold, Highlight, Summarize, Rewrite.\\u201D Progressive Ideation is: \\u201CComment, Convert, Connect, Create.\\u201D For the sake of the quality of your thinking, the difference is night and day. Make comments (and highlights) as you go. Convert them into new notes. Progressive Ideation Creates Real Value When you read something new, what if you added comments as you went? (Nothing major, just some comments like you were having an engaging conversation with a friend.) What if you converted some of that information into new notes, each representing a new idea, each written in your own words? What if you then linked these new ideas to existing ideas in your note library?
