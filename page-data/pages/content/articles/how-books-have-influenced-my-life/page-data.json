I love reading. I really do. It is has become my go to activity. Whenever I am a bit frustrated(which happens often) I start reading to calm my mind. If I am getting bored I no longer tend towards YouTube. I tend towards reading. My go to series of choice is of course the one and only Sherlock Holmes. I love that series. I have read through all of its glorious 1800 or so pages twice and have heard it all on audible over 6 times. My favourite story is 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' and it won't be an exaggeration to say that I feel the same sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which had submerged Dr. Watson's mind.\\nI didn't love reading from the start. In fact, I was quite annoyed at the thought of reading because I associated books with boring school work in which I had zero interest. But still there was something intriguing about the fact of owning a book. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but now I can. It was probably signaling. The possession of books indicates knowledge. I used to gather a lot of books but never read the. Back then, my world of entertainment only used to comprise of cartoons and then one day, I saw sitting on a bookshelf, was a Ben 10 book. Just for some background, Ben 10 was one of my favourite cartoons of all time(and still is!). So I naturally got it and then I read the first book that I wasn't forced to.
