Sometimes, you just can't fall asleep. No matter how hard you try it just seems impossible. This is a problem that I have faced a number of times before.

So lets approach this logically.\"), mdx(\"li\", null, \"There are two main reasons that prohibit you to fall asleep, the environment and your brain.

You may have heard of it. Basically, what it does is that it tells your brain that it is now dark and you should fall asleep. Now you may realise how important this hormone is.

You have to not watch TV at night. Keep your phones in silent mode and put them away. I know that this requires a lot of self-discipline and effort. While putting your phone away you may think what if someone messages me? But the truth is really that no one mostly needs an urgent reply at night. Everyone can wait. If it is so necessary then you can choose to only mute messages not calls. If it is a message then it can most probably wait.\"), mdx(\"li\", null, \"Now, one more giant thing which you can do is follow a consistent schedule. You \", mdx(\"strong\", null, \"SHOULD\"), \" to fall asleep and then wake up at the same time everyday no matter if it is a weekend or not. This is a common mistake that people make in constructing a sleep schedule, The mistake is that they often think that I can be easier on weekends. It is not that you should get your healthy 8 hours of sleep only on weekends and try to sleep less in weekdays. Sleep depravation can't be accumulated only to sorted later.

I find this method a bit excessive so I tend to use the 4-3-5 method. You have to count till 4 while inhaling then hold your breath counting till 3 and exhale while counting till 5.
