The first is a change in their circadian rhythm. The second is early school start times. The complications of early school start times are inextricably linked with the first issue\\u2014a shift in circadian rhythm. As young children, we often wished to stay up late so we could watch television, or engage with parents and older siblings in whatever it was that they were doing at night. But when given that chance, sleep would usually get the better of us. The reason is not simply that children need more sleep than their older siblings or parents, but also that the circadian rhythm of a young child runs on an earlier schedule. Children therefore become sleepy earlier and wake up earlier than their adult parents. Adolescent teenagers, however, have a different circadian rhythm from their young siblings. During puberty, the timing of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is shifted progressively forward: a change that is common across all adolescents, irrespective of culture or geography. So far forward, in fact, it passes even the timing of their adult parents. As a nine-year-old, the circadian rhythm would have the child asleep by around nine PM, driven in part by the rising tide of melatonin at this time in children. By the time that same individual has reached sixteen years of age, their circadian rhythm has undergone a dramatic shift forward in its cycling phase. The rising tide of melatonin, and the instruction of darkness and sleep, is many hours away. As a consequence, the sixteen-year-old will usually have no interest in sleeping at nine PM. Instead, peak wakefulness is usually still in play at that hour. By the time the parents are getting tired, as their circadian rhythms take a downturn and melatonin release instructs sleep\\u2014perhaps around ten or eleven PM, their teenager can still be wide awake. A few more hours must pass before the circadian rhythm of a teenage brain begins to shut down alertness and allow for easy, sound sleep to begin. This, of course, leads to much angst and frustration for all parties involved on the back end of sleep. Parents want their teenager to be awake at a \\u201Creasonable\\u201D hour of the morning. Teenagers, on the other hand, having only been capable of initiating sleep some hours after their parents, can still be in their trough of the circadian downswing.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"No matter how much that teenager truly wishes to obey your instruction, and no matter what amount of willed effort is applied by either of the two parties, the circadian rhythm of a teenager will not be miraculously coaxed into a change. Furthermore, asking that same teenager to wake up at seven the next morning and function with intellect, grace, and good mood is the equivalent of asking their parent, to do the same at four or five AM. Sadly, neither society nor our parental attitudes are well designed to appreciate or accept that teenagers need more sleep than adults, and that they are biologically wired to obtain that sleep at a different time from their parents. Parents would be wise to accept this fact, and to embrace it, encourage it, and praise it, lest they wish their own children to suffer developmental brain abnormalities or force a raised risk of mental illness upon them. It will not always be this way for the teenager. As they age into young and middle adulthood, their circadian schedule will gradually slide back in time.\")), mdx(\"hr\", null), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If you want to learn more about sleep check out \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Why+we+sleep&qid=1596073098&sr=8-1\"\n  }), \"Why we sleep\"), \" by Mathew Walker\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"üí§ Why is sleep so necessary?","tags":["üß¨LifeImprovement","üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èHealth","üò¥Sleep"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/content/articles/why-is-sleep-so-necessary/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
