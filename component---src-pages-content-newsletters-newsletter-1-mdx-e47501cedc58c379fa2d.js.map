Let’s call this…</li>\n   <li>Progressive Ideation.</li>\n   <li><ul>\n   <li>Why care? </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n   <li>The very essence and quality of our thinking is at stake. Why relegate your best thinking to the last step in an elaborate process? If you are a knowledge worker, an entrepreneur, or just someone who likes to think — Progressive Summarization must die.</li>\n   <li><ul>\n   <li>Progressive Summarization Creates False Confidence </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n   <li>The Collector’s Fallacy — coined by Christian Tietze — argues that the act of “collecting” is easy. It feels like progress but it’s not.</li>\n   <li>The same is true with the act of “summarizing”. Let’s call it…</li>\n   <li>The Summarizer’s Fallacy.</li>\n   <li>The last major reason why Progressive Summarization must die is that it doesn’t effectively grow and evolve with you over time.</li>\n   <li><ul>\n   <li>In summary… </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n   <li>1. Progressive Summarization creates a false sense of achievement.  </li>\n   <li>2. Progressive Summarization encourages regurgitative thinking.  </li>\n   <li>3. Progressive Summarization doesn’t build a dynamic digital library.</li>\n   <li><ul>\n   <li>What is Progressive Ideation </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n   <li>Progressive Summarization is: “Copy, Bold, Highlight, Summarize, Rewrite.”</li>\n   <li>Progressive Ideation is: “Comment, Convert, Connect, Create.”</li>\n   <li>For the sake of the quality of your thinking, the difference is night and day.</li>\n   <li>Make comments (and highlights) as you go. </li>\n   <li>Convert them into new notes. </li>\n   <li><ul>\n   <li>Progressive Ideation Creates Real Value </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n   <li>When you read something new, what if you added comments as you went? (Nothing major, just some comments like you were having an engaging conversation with a friend.) </li>\n   <li>What if you converted some of that information into new notes, each representing a new idea, each written in your own words? </li>\n   <li>What if you then linked these new ideas to existing ideas in your note library? </li>\n   <li><ul>\n   <li>Progressive Ideation Encourages Connective Thinking </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n   </ul>\n   </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
